# 🚦 Streamlit Labs for Routing
A curated collection of **Streamlit applications** focused on routing, traffic analysis, EV-based logistics, and geospatial visualization.

This repository serves as a centralized hub for small-to-medium sized tools built for:
- 🚚 Vehicle routing problems (VRP / EVRP / CEVRPTW)  
- 🗺️ Map-based visualization of routes, requests, and events  
- 🔥 Real-time traffic flow and incident analysis  
- 📡 Dynamic request simulation & operational monitoring  
- 🛰️ Urban analytics and geo-intelligence experiments  

Each tool lives in its own folder and is fully self-contained.
